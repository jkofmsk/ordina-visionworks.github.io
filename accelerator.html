                                            Spark is a fast and general engine designed for large-scale processing. It runs programs much faster than Hadoop MapReduce and allows multiple programming languages like Java, Scala, Python & R. Being able to use Spark, implies being able to combine the art of data science &amp; big data. Learn the data science with using Spark with this two-day workshop.

                                                Data science is a complex process that requires business understanding, IT skills and a thorough mathematics or machine learning knowledge. Being an expert in all three is impossible, meaning that knowing the best practices, main pitfalls or struggles are of high value.

During this development we learned a lot and bundled that experience into a best practices framework. Get an overview of our solutions and rebuild one of them as we are convinced learning is easiest by doing!

Unfortunately the visualization's characteristics will always stay limited to the features the tool provides. With D3.js, a language that for instance integrates with Tableau, these limitations are forever gone. Something not possible in your tool, no worries after this course, you just create the visual or feature yourself and bring your visualizations to the next level!

These can exist in your database model, your semantic layer, but most of all in your ETL process. With BIML you will implement the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept throughout your development, making your life easier as repeating architectural changes make their way into the scope. Learn how to harness the power of BIML to speed up your development and maintenance tasks on your ETL.

This is usually a dedicated role in the IT department in the large organization. It can be outsourced or contracted to specialized vendors. The primary role of a database administrator includes Database Security, Database Tuning, Database Monitoring, Backup and Recovery.

All these questions are answered by database developers. Just like regular developers, they concern themselves with the deployment of the databases, their versioning, the continuous integration and automated deployments of the database projects, the prototyping and lifecycle management.

From on-premises to cloud and hybrid solutions and even in embedded and mobile solutions. As BI developers we do have to keep in mind that Power BI is much more than just a visualization tool. It includes the powerfull SSAS Tabular and Power Query engines which both require an expertise on their own. Learn Power BI end to end and prepare for the MCSA certification.

SSIS is the tool of choice for many because of its simplicity to get started with it, and its extendability if you need to load some unconventional data. Start off your SSIS development and upgrade your skills with best practices and advanced ETL patterns.
