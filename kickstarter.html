                            In this hands-on training course, participants will learn how to use the SSISDB 
                            Catalog in SQL Server and use this knowledge to create reports on the data. By 
                            using different visualization tools (such as Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, R, Qlikview,…) 
                            the participants will turn this large complex database into an easy understandable report 
                            or dashboard, which can be used to find better and faster solutions on different questions.

            In this hands-on training course, participants will learn how to use SSIS packages for importing multiple flatfiles using variables and loops into a SQL Server. On top of that, participants will learn on how to denormalise data into an already existing and in-use database schema using TSQL statements, stored procedures and functions.

                This two-day hands-on training course delivers the key concepts and expertise participants need to read data, clean up data and transform data using Spark. They learn how Spark is built on map-reduce jobs and learn the key concepts to work with parallel processing software such as Spark. This course offers them the knowledge to tackle an end-to-end data science project with the help of a real-life case.

                <p>
                    This hand-on training course, which can be given over the course of one or two days based on the amount or exercises given, introduces the core concepts of dimensional modeling (facts, dimensions,…) and follows up with more advanced topics such as conformed dimensions, fact-dimensions matrixes, MOLAP,… The course is largely technology agnostic as it focusses on the concepts and design principles. As such, it is a prerequisite to learning to use the technologies to implement a Data Warehouse. Although the course focusses on the theory, it uses lots of hands on exercises and enables discussions of the different implementations amongst the students.

                        An excellent way to help people explore and understand Big Data, is visualizing the data. After all we are usually very good at understanding patterns, tendencies, anomalies, etc. through visualization. With a number of specific examples you will learn how suitable interactive visualizations can be built, wat the typical misconceptions are, how visualizations can be misused,… An overview of typical techniques and aides for interactive information-visualization will also be presented. This course does not discuss any tools for data visualization.

                            In this 3 day hands on session you will learn all about TSQL. Starting with the very basics of TSQL (Workings, SELECT, Join), going into the common used items (subqueries, functions, stored procedures). Eventually ending with the more advanced features SQL Server has to offer (Windowing functions, Recursive CTE, …).

At the end of the training you will understand the business case behind the Mail Analytics Solution and you will be able to scrape an Outlook mailbox and the web (first steps). Furthermore you will have some basic knowledge on how to process and transform text data and you get some hands-on experience in training and evaluating a predictive model.

                                    Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want. During this training you will learn how to load, transform and visualize your data into insights by using Microsoft Power BI.

This course shows you how to use SQL Server Data Tools to build "cubes" of the data tied up in your data warehouse or day-to-day transactional database, and use these to monitor KPIs, perform data-mining and much more.

It becomes clear that Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is the toolset used to help you implement data integration process applications among your business application system's files and databases. But applicants also learn SSIS is much more than a simple extract, transform, and load (ETL) process. Using SSIS, they learn you can select data from one or more sources and standardize, join, merge, cleanse, augment, derive, calculate, and perform just about any other function and operation required for your data integration applications.
